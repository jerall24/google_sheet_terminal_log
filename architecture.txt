Vision:
Type in commands that will connect to a Google Sheet and run specific actions based on the commands

Action word: go
Actions:  new - append a new log to the document
          last - get the last log that was pushed to the document
          del - delete the specified log

Terminal:
$ go new -p <project_name> <note/comment> -- new row at the top of the document
$ go new <note/comment> -- new row at the top of the document with same project as previous
$ go last -- get last log
$ go last -p <project_name> -- get last log of that project
$ go last -n <number_of_logs> -- get last n logs
$ go del -- delete last log
$ go del -p <project_name> -- delete last log of that project
$ go del -l <log_id> -- delete specific log
$ go del -A <project_name> -- delete entire project (give confirmation)

Keep thinking about this below. Do you need to restructure "last" command?
$ go list -- List all messages of last project
$ go list -p <project_name> -- List all messages of project_name
$ go list -n <number_of_logs> -- list the last n logs of the last project
$ go list -np <number_of_logs> <project_name> -- list n logs of a project
